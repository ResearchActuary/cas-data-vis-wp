## Work Stream 1 – Fundamentals

1. Introduction to Data Visualization
	* Definition of “Data Viz”
	* Background (Brief)
	* Why Actuaries Need to Know Data Visualization basics
2. Consider the Audience
	* Things to consider
		1. What is their role? What is their background?
		2. How technical are they? What do they already know?
		3. Who are their constituents? What are their motivations?
		4. How much detail do they really need? How much will suit them?
	* What is the message
		1. What does the Audience need know to influence the decision?
		2. What is the Audience supposed to DO with the information?
		3. Write down what Audience should takeaway
3. How to Choose the Type of Visualization
	* Text-Only
		* When to Use
		* Example
	* Table
		* When to Use
		* Example
		* Heatmap colors by magnitude
	* Line
	* Bar
		* Start at zero
	* Scatterplot
	* Box & Whisker, Violin
	* Map
	* Small Multiples aka Trellis charts
	* Sparklines
	* Nodes and Connections
	* Visualizations to Avoid
		* Pie and Donuts
		* 3D
		* Double-Axis
4. How to Design the Visualization
	* Default settings are usually poor data viz
	* How to Simplify
		* High Data-to-Ink Ratio
		* Remove or use gray to tone-down Borders, Axes, Gridlines, tick marks 
		* Combine Title and the Message, or callout box for the Message
		* Short Axis names
		* No vertical text
		* Approx. 2:1 for length:width aspect ratio
	* How to Make the Data ‘POP’
		* cognitive load; short-term memory
		* Pre-attentive Attributes and Gestalt principles…
			* List of PP and Gestalt…
		* Hierarchy of comparisons of magnitude
			* Position along common scale
			* Position along non-aligned scale
			* Length
			* Direction/Angle
			* Area
			* Color and Shading saturation
			* Color hue
			* Volume
		* Hierarchy of identifying Categories
			* Spatial Region
			* Color
			* Motion
			* Shape
