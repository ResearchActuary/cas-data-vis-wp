1.	Introduction to Data Visualization
    A.	Definition of “Data Viz”
    B.	Background (Brief)
    C.	Why Actuaries Need to Know Data Visualization basics
2.	Consider the Audience
    A.	Things to Consider about the Audience
        i.	What is their role? What is their background?
        ii.	How technical are they? What do they already know?
        iii.	Who are their constituents? What are their motivations?
        iv.	How much detail do they really need? How much will suit them?
    B.	“What is the message?”
        i.	What does the Audience need know to influence the decision?
        ii.	What is the Audience supposed to DO with the information?
        iii.	Write down what Audience should takeaway
3.	How to Choose the Type of Visualization

        ii.	Example
    B.	Table
        i.	When to Use
        ii.	Example
        iii.	Heatmap colors by magnitude
    C.	Line
    D.	Bar
        i.	Start at zero
    E.	Scatterplot
    F.	Box & Whisker, Violin
    G.	Map
    H.	Small Multiples aka Trellis charts
    I.	Sparklines
    J.	Nodes and Connections
    K.	Visualizations to Avoid
        i.	Pie and Donuts
        ii.	3D
        iii.	Double-Axis
4.	How to Design the Visualization
    A.	Default settings are usually poor data viz
    B.	How to Simplify
        i.	High Data-to-Ink Ratio
        ii.	Remove or use gray to tone-down Borders, Axes, Gridlines, tick marks 
        iii.	Combine Title and the Message, or callout box for the Message
        iv.	Short Axis names
        v.	No vertical text
        vi.	Approx. 2:1 for length:width aspect ratio
    C.	How to Make the Data ‘POP’
        i.	Cognitive Load; short-term memory 
        ii.	Pre-attentive Attributes and Gestalt principles…
            1.	List of PP and Gestalt…
        iii.	Hierarchy of comparisons of magnitude
            1.	Position along common scale
            2.	Position along non-aligned scale
            3.	Length
