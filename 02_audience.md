# Consider the Audience
When we need to create visuals to present quantitative information, instead of jumping straight to the designing stage, the first thing we should do is "understanding the context for the need to communicate" [Knaflic, 2015, p. 18]. The context can be split into two parts: the audience and the intended message.

## Who is the audience

**1. What is their role? What is their background?**  
Actuarial findings and recommendations are used by various groups of audience such as fellow actuaries, underwriters, brokers, auditors and many more. A common pitfall is that we tend to generalize the target audience group to "internal and external stakeholders" or "anyone who may be interested". Since audiences with different roles and backgrounds would have different interests and perception of the visuals, we should narrow the target audience [Knaflic, 2015, p. 21]. When we tailor the visual for each specific audience group, the intended message can be articulated more accurately and effectively.

**2. How technical are they? What do they already know?**  
Actuarial analyses can be technical and difficult to comprehend for non-actuarial audience groups, especially with all the actuarial terms and acronyms. For technical audience, the presenter can be confident to incorporate technical terms, statistical diagnostics and tests in the visuals, to establish common ground with the audience. On the other hand, for non-technical audience, the presenter should use common visuals and analogy to simplify the concept and deliver key message.


**3. Who are their constituents? What are their motivations?**  
Actuaries are often accountable for setting assumptions, building models, managing risks, and providing recommendations. A common pitfall is that we are tempted to showcase all the steps in our analysis, but the audience is only interested in the explanatory aspect of our anaysis instead of the exploratory aspect. Therefore, we should design our visuals to focus on the explanatory aspect of the data analysis to the intended audience.


## What is the message

**1. What does the Audience need know to influence the decision?**  
An effective data visualization should provide the audience with sufficient and relevant details to make the decision. The audience need to know what is the key question or problem the presenter is trying to address.

**2. How much detail do they really need? How much will suit them?**  
For in-person presentations, the presenter has much control over the flow of the storytelling process, so the visualizations used do not need to be overwhelmed with details because the audience won't have enough time to digest. It's better for the presenter to highlight the decision-influencing visuals to guide the audience. 

**3. What is the Audience supposed to DO with the information?**  
The presenter should state exlicitly action items and/or next steps at the end of the presentation to guide the audience on what they are supposed to do with the information presented.

**4. Write down what Audience should takeaway**
