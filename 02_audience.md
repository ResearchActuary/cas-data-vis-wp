# Consider the Audience

## Things to consider

**1. What is their role? What is their background?**  
Often, a report or presentation is created for a broad group of audiences, but this generalization could result in problematic situations such as slides over-filled with technical details that intimidates non-technical readers, or lengthy reports for executives to miss key takeaways. Therefore, the presenter should narrow the target audience and have different communications for difference audiences. The first question the presenter need to prepare is to understand the audience's role and background. 



**2. How technical are they? What do they already know?**  
The first distinction can be whether the audience is a technical expert or non-technical. For technical audience, the presenter can be confident to use technical terms that are common in the industry to establish common ground with the audience. On the other hand, for non-technical audience, the presenter should use analogy to simplify the concept and deliver key message.


**3. Who are their constituents? What are their motivations?**  
The audience often has an interest in finding out the trend, conclusion, message implied by data to help them make decision, so the presenter should focus on communicating the explanatory aspect of their data analysis to the audience.

**4. How much detail do they really need? How much will suit them?**  
For in-person presentations, the presenter has much control over the flow of the storytelling process, so the visualizations used do not need to be overwhelmed with details because the audience won't have enough time to digest. It's better for the presenter to highlight the decision-influencing visuals to guide the audience. 

## What is the message

**1. What does the Audience need know to influence the decision?**  
An effective data visualization should provide the audience with sufficient and relevant details to make the decision. The audience need to know what is the key question or problem the presenter is trying to address.

**2. What is the Audience supposed to DO with the information?**  
The presenter should state exlicitly action items and/or next steps at the end of the presentation to guide the audience on what they are supposed to do with the information presented.

**3. Write down what Audience should takeaway**
