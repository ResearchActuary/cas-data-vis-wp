# Consider the Audience
When we create data visualizations to present quantitative information, instead of jumping straight to the designing stage, we should first understand "the context for the need to communicate" [Knaflic, 2015, p. 18]. The context can be split into two parts: the target audience and the intended message.

## Who is the Audience

**1. What is their role? What is their background?**  
Actuaries can use different kinds of visualizations to communicate actuarial findings and recommendations to various groups such as fellow actuaries, regulators, underwriters, brokers, C-suite executives and many more. A common pitfall is that we tend to generalize the target audience group to "internal and external stakeholders" or "anyone who may be interested" [Knaflic, 2015, p. 21]. These generic groups include audiences with different roles and backgrounds, so it's more difficult to accomodate the different interests and perceptions of the visualizations, and possibly result in mis-use or mis-interpretation of the visualization. Therefore, we should tailor the visualizations to a specific audience group for better accuracy and effectiveness. In order to narrow the target audience group, Knaflic recommends identifying the decision maker of the addressing problem.

**2. How technical are they? What do they already know?**  
After defining the target audience group, the presenter should find out about the audience's technical knowledge level. Actuarial analyses can be too technical and difficult to comprehend for non-actuarial groups, especially with the large collection of actuarial acronyms, terms and methods. When designing a visualization for non-actuarial audience, a good strategy is to resonate with them by using basic visualization forms and simple analogy to establish common ground with them. On the other hand, when designing a visualization for actuarial audience, the presenter can be confident to incorporate technical terms, statistical tests and diagnostics to build trust and credibility with the audience.

## What is the Message

**1. What does the audience need know to influence the decision?**  
After we are familiarized with the target audience's role and technical background, we should think about how to make the visualization relevant for the audience. In other words, what information needs to be included in the visualization to help the audience make decision. Knaflic clarifies an important disctinction between exploratory analysis and explanatory analysis. Exploratory analysis refers to the preliminary work we do "to understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others" [Knaflic, 2015, p. 19], and explanatory analysis refers to the "specific thing you want to explain" or the "specific story you want to tell" [Knaflic, 2015, p. 20]. We should focus on the explanatory aspect of our work in the visualizations to influence the audience's decision.

**2. How much detail do they really need? How much will suit them?**  
According to Knaflic, the communication mechanism determines how much control the presenter has on how the target audience consumes the information, which in turn determines the level of detail a visualization needs [Knaflic, 2015, p. 23]. For example, during a live presentation, the presenter has the most control over the flow of the storytelling process. If the audience has question about a particular point, the presenter can answer right away and provide more details in person, so the visualizations in the presentation deck do not need to be over-filled with details. However, for written documents like emails and reports, the presenter has less control on when and how the audience will interpret the visualization, so it's better to include more details to communicate the intended message and address potential questions.

**3. What is the audience supposed to DO with the information?**  
It's important to remember that after we inform the audience about the problem and key insights, we should guide them to take actions to resolve the problem. We can explicitly state the next steps, provide recommendations, or encourage discussions for situations where next step is unclear [Knaflic, 2015, p. 22].
