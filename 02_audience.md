# Consider the Audience
When we need to create visuals to present quantitative information, instead of jumping straight to the designing stage, the first thing we should do is "understanding the context for the need to communicate" [Knaflic, 2015, p. 18]. The context can be split into two parts: the audience and the intended message.

## Who is the audience

**1. What is their role? What is their background?**  
Actuarial findings and recommendations are used by various groups such as fellow actuaries, underwriters, brokers, regulators, auditors and many more. A common pitfall is that we tend to generalize the target audience group to "internal and external stakeholders" or "anyone who may be interested". Since audiences with different roles and backgrounds would have different interests and perception of the visuals, we should narrow the target audience, and create different communications for these different audiences [Knaflic, 2015, p. 21]. When we tailor the visual for each specific audience group, the intended message can be articulated more accurately and effectively. Who the audience is may also determine whether the presentation should be live/interactive or whether it is appropriate to send the audience the visuals to view on their own.

**2. How technical are they? What do they already know?**  
Actuarial analyses can be technical and difficult to comprehend for non-actuarial audience groups, especially with all the actuarial terms and acronyms. For technical audience, the presenter can be confident to incorporate technical terms, statistical diagnostics and tests in the visuals, to establish common ground with the audience. On the other hand, for non-technical audience, in the visuals the presenter may use more general concepts, or show how it affects the bottom line, or use an analogy, to simplify the concept and deliver the key message. 


**3. Who are their constituents? What are their motivations?**  
Actuaries are often making assumptions, building models, making conclusions, and providing recommendations. A common pitfall is that we are tempted to showcase *all* the steps in our analysis, but the audience is only interested in the **explanatory** aspect of our anaysis instead of the exploratory aspect. Therefore, we should design our visuals to focus on the explanatory aspect of the data analysis to the intended audience. For example, an underwriter may rather see how a change in selected tail factor affects the bottom line loss ratio, whereas another actuary may want to see all the indicated tail factors underlying the change in selected tail factor. Think about what motivates your audience.


## "What is the message?"
When crafting visuals, a content creator should continually ask themselves and fellow workers "What is the message?". Asking this question and other related questions below helps refine the content, complexity, and nature of visual presentations. 

**1. What does the audience need know to influence the decision?**  
An effective data visualization should provide the audience with sufficient and relevant information to make a decision. The audience needs to know what the key question is, or what problem the presenter is trying to address.

**2. How much detail do they really need? How much detail will suit them?**  
For in-person presentations, the presenter has much control over the flow of the storytelling process, so the visualizations used do not need to be overwhelmed with details because the audience won't have enough time to digest. It's better for the presenter to highlight the decision-influencing visuals to guide the audience. What would you show if you only had half the time or half the content (i.e. number of slides, graphs, or pages)?

**3. What is the audience supposed to do with the information?**  
The presenter may want to write down (for themselves) what the audience should takeaway, which will help provide a strong basis for the creation of the visuals. The presenter may also state exlicitly action items and/or next steps at the end of the presentation to guide the audience on what they are supposed to do with the information presented.
